(a) The Services to be provided hereunder shall be performed with the same general degree of care, at the same general level and at
the same general degree of accuracy and responsiveness, as when performed within the McDermott organization (including, for this purpose,
B&W and its subsidiaries) prior to the date of this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that B&W and the members of the B&W Group are
not professional providers of the types of services included in the Services and that B&W personnel performing Services have other
responsibilities and will not be dedicated full-time to performing Services hereunder.

(b) In the event B&W or any member of the B&W Group fails to provide, or cause to be provided, the Services in accordance with the
standard of service set forth in Section 2.5(a) or Section 2.5(c), the sole and exclusive remedy of McDermott shall be, at McDermott’s sole
discretion, within 90 days from the date that B&W or such member of the B&W Group first fails to provide such Service, to not pay for such
Service; provided that in the event B&W defaults in the manner described in clause (ii) of Section 7.1, McDermott shall have the further
rights set forth in Article VII.

(c) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 2.5, NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OR CONFORMITY TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR DESCRIPTION), ARE MADE BY B&W OR ANY MEMBER OF THE B&W GROUP
WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL
SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY WAIVED AND DISCLAIMED. MCDERMOTT (ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON
BEHALF OF EACH OTHER MEMBER OF THE MII GROUP) HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT MCDERMOTT OR ANY MEMBER OF
THE MII GROUP MAY OTHERWISE HAVE FOR ANY LOSSES, TO ENFORCE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR TO PURSUE ANY OTHER
REMEDY AVAILABLE IN CONTRACT, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY IN THE EVENT OF ANY NON-PERFORMANCE, INADEQUATE
PERFORMANCE,

FAULTY PERFORMANCE OR OTHER FAILURE OR BREACH BY B&W OR ANY MEMBER OF THE B&W GROUP UNDER OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR
ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OF B&W OR ANY MEMBER OF THE B&W GROUP OR ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER AND WHETHER
DAMAGES ARE ASSERTED IN CONTRACT OR TORT, UNDER FEDERAL, STATE OR NON U.S. LAWS OR OTHER STATUTE OR OTHERWISE;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER SHALL NOT EXTEND TO COVER, AND B&W SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR,
SUCH LOSSES CAUSED BY THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF B&W OR ANY MEMBER OF THE B&W GROUP. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE B&W GROUP BE LIABLE TO THE MII GROUP WITH
RESPECT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR AMOUNTS IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEEDING THE AGGREGATE SERVICE
CHARGES PAID HEREUNDER BY THE MII GROUP.
