preceding the original claim. Each Party agrees to use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate

extent that any act or omission of the other Party and/or its Personnel contributed to the

the Client or its Personnel for any liability howsoever arising to the extent caused by the
occurrence of a Relief Event.

connection with this Agreement, whether in contract or outside contract, unless formal
commencement of legal proceedings is brought within 2 years after the other Party

provided that neither Party will be liable by virtue of this Clause 21 for any longer period than would
otherwise apply by operation of law.

nature of the Services, the negotiated Charges and the ability of the Parties to rely on their own
respective insurance arrangements and other resources to bear or recover any loss or damage incurred
for which the other Party is not liable.
